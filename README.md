installed wireshark from the original website 
captured packets for local connection 
and in order to ngenerate network traffic browsed the google and captured the packets by protocols like tcp,udp,https,dns
and finally searched for any malicious traffic but it was not found on my network 
there were few failed SYN packets and  most were succesfull ACK packets and DNS queries were responded
from this iwas able understand how to use wireshark and able capture packets
